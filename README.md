# 🍬 Fudgel
The Meta-Language of Intent. Orchestrating complexity by doing "nothing" at all.

# ✨ What is Fudgel?
Fudgel is not a general-purpose programming language in the traditional sense. It is a declarative orchestration layer, more like SQL for Applications than Python or C.

Fudgel is the emergent result of three core Data Sublanguages (DSLs) running in a single, unified substrate. 

It describes the intent of an application, while specialized runtimes handle the execution, keeping the core logic deterministic, concurrent, and ultra-efficient.

# 🧠 The Core Philosophy
Modern web stacks are heavy and fragmented. Fudgel applies Game Engine optimizations (ECS, Signal Graphs, and Determinism) to general-purpose applications. It doesn't "work" in the traditional sense; it describes the state and lets the engine and specialized runtimes handle the heavy lifting.

# 🏗️ The Ecosystem
Fudgel is built on a modular stack of Data Sublanguages (DSLs) and atomic libraries, each sandboxed to their own data and designed to compile down to bare-metal instructions.

# 🛡️ The Fudgel Trinity
Fudgel's architecture exists at the intersection of three distinct pillars :
| DSL    | Meaning | Implementation | Responsibility |
|--------|---------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Bija   | Seed    | Static Entity Component System | It defines the "what", the data structures and state.|
| Rumus  | Formula | Functional Logic | It defines the "how", the pure transformations and mathematical rules. |
| Viesti | Relay   | Signal Graph | It defines the "where", the reactive flow and propagation of data between Bija and Rumus.| 

# 📚 Specialized Libraries
While the DSL's form the core language, Fudgel also orchestrates an ecosystem of Domain-Specific Libraries. Each is "agnostic", they don't know about each other; they only know how to operate on the Bija state they are given.

| Library | Meaning        | Responsibility                         |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Tipus   | Type           | User Input handling.                   |
| Ehto    | Constraint     | Type checking and validation.          |
| Primi   | First          | Memory management and receiving.       |
| Lifga   | Revive         | Timing, Sequences, Animation           |
| Aquilla | Eagle          | Visibility and direct-to-GPU rendering.|
| Kadro   | Frame          | Layout and structural templates.       |
| Smink   | Makeup         | Styling, formatting, and theming.      |
| Rezo    | Network        | High-performance network handling.     |
| Zapis   | Record         | File system and database I/O.          |
| Giya    | Guidance       | Accessibility and semantic markers.    |
| Hloov   | Change         | Translation and localization.          |
| Kani    | Sound          | Audio processing and playback.         |
| Písmo   | Font           | Text formatting and typography.        |
| Cead    | Permission     | User access control and security.      |
| Nyem    | Squeeze        | Compression and storage optimization.  |
| Drysu   | Tangled        | Encryption and cryptographic safety.   |

# 🚀 Key Features
- **Signal-Based Concurrency:** Replaces complex procedural threading with an atomic Signal System for safe, reactive data flow.
- **ECS Architecture:** High-performance data management borrowed from game development.
- **Portable Application Format:** A specialized execution model that bypasses standard DOM/CSS parsing for near-instant rendering.
- **Deterministic by Design:** The same input and orchestration will always yield the same state.
- **Phrase-Binding UX:** *(Experimental)* A unique input system where keywords and constructs are invoked through customizable phrase/keyboard bindings.

# 🛠️ Status: Under Development

Fudgel is currently in the brainstorming and architectural prototyping phase. It is "usable" only when the development environment fully supports the interplay of its three core DSLs. Our primary goals are:
- The Fudgel IDE: A phrase-bound, visual-textual environment where Bija, Rumus, and Viesti can be composed.
- The PAF (Portable Application Format): A binary-efficient format that stores the orchestrated intent of the Three DSL's.
- The Fudgel Runtime: A specialized execution environment (the "Fudgel Browser") that consumes PAF files and renders them directly to the hardware.

The goal is to move away from the mess of traditional web dev and toward a unified environment where layout, logic, and rendering are perfectly synchronized.

# 🛣️ Current Roadmap:

- **Core:** Stabilizing the Bija ECS data propagation engine.

- **Visual Bridge:** Initializing the Aquila/Kadro/Smink layout-to-render pipeline.

- **Fudgel Runtime:** Developing the "Fudgel Browser" for running .paf files directly.
