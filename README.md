The Meta-Language of Intent. Orchestrating complexity by doing "nothing" at all.

# ✨ What is Fudgel?
Fudgel is a declarative, orchestration-centric programming language and ecosystem. Unlike traditional languages that focus on *how* to execute code, Fudgel focuses on the **semantic structure** of an application, and how the data propagates.

Derived from the archaic English word meaning "to pretend to work when in reality one is not doing anything," Fudgel acts as a high-level conductor. It coordinates a specialized stack of libraries to handle execution, keeping the core logic deterministic, concurrent, and ultra-efficient.

# 🧠 The Core Philosophy
Modern web stacks are heavy and fragmented. Fudgel applies Game Engine optimizations (ECS, Signal Graphs, and Determinism) to general-purpose applications. It doesn't "work" in the traditional sense; it describes the state and lets the engine and specialized runtimes handle the heavy lifting.

# 🏗️ The Ecosystem

Fudgel is built on a modular stack of Data Sublanguages (DSLs) and atomic libraries, each sandboxed to their own data and designed to compile down to bare-metal instructions.

# 🛡️ Core DSLs
The three pillars of the Fudgel architecture:
| DSL    | Meaning | Responsibility                                           |
|--------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Bija   | Seed    | Entity Component System (ECS) — The data substrate.      |
| Rumus  | Formula | Functional Programming — Pure logic and transformations. |
| Viesti | Relay   | Signal Graph — Reactive event and data propagation.      | 

# 📚 Specialized Libraries
Each library is "agnostic" and focuses on a single domain of the application:
| Library | Meaning        | Responsibility                         |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Tipus   | Type           | User Input handling.                   |
| Ehto    | Constraint     | Type checking and validation.          |
| Primi   | First          | Memory management and receiving.       |
| Lifga   | Revive         | Timing, Sequences, Animation           |
| Aquilla | Eagle          | Visibility and direct-to-GPU rendering.|
| Kadro   | Frame          | Layout and structural templates.       |
| Smink   | Makeup         | Styling, formatting, and theming.      |
| Rezo    | Network        | High-performance network handling.     |
| Zapis   | Record         | File system and database I/O.          |
| Giya    | Guidance       | Accessibility and semantic markers.    |
| Hloov   | Change         | Translation and localization.          |
| Kani    | Sound          | Audio processing and playback.         |
| Písmo   | Font           | Text formatting and typography.        |
| Cead    | Permission     | User access control and security.      |
| Nyem    | Squeeze        | Compression and storage optimization.  |
| Drysu   | Tangled        | Encryption and cryptographic safety.   |

# 🚀 Key Features
- **Signal-Based Concurrency:** Replaces complex procedural threading with an atomic Signal System for safe, reactive data flow.
- **ECS Architecture:** High-performance data management borrowed from game development.
- **Portable Application Format:** A specialized execution model that bypasses standard DOM/CSS parsing for near-instant rendering.
- **Deterministic by Design:** The same input and orchestration will always yield the same state.
- **Phrase-Binding UX:** *(Experimental)* A unique input system where keywords and constructs are invoked through customizable phrase/keyboard bindings.

# 🛠️ Status: Under Development

Fudgel is currently in the brainstorming and architectural prototyping phase.

The goal is to move away from the "Text-Editing Anxiety" of traditional web dev and toward a unified environment where layout, logic, and rendering are perfectly synchronized.

# 🛣️ Current Roadmap:

- **Core:** Stabilizing the Bija ECS data propagation engine.

- **Visual Bridge:** Initializing the Aquila/Kadro/Smink layout-to-render pipeline.

- **Fudgel Runtime:** Developing the "Fudgel Browser" for running .paf files directly.
